Microsoft Excel is one of the most basic tools used for data analysis. Listed below are some projects I have done using MS Excel.

### [Excel Training Course](https://github.com/deoflores/Portfolio_Projects/blob/main/Excel%20Dashboards%20with%20Power%20Query/Excel%20Training%20Course%20with%20Answers.xlsx)

A simple training course I designed to train colleagues on basic analytics using MS Excel. This course was designed to train individuals with limited background on MS Excel and covered topics from data types to lookups, logical and aggregation functions, and pivot tables and pivot charts.

### [E-Commerce Voucher Campaign Dashboard](https://github.com/deoflores/Portfolio_Projects/blob/main/Excel%20Dashboards%20with%20Power%20Query/E-Commerce%20Voucher%20Campaign%20Dashboard.xlsx)

This is a dashboard created in MS Excel using Power Query to import data from different sheets, and Power Pivot to define relationships between tables. This is similar to an actual dashboard I created that tracks the performance of an e-commerce voucher campaign to entice app downloads.
